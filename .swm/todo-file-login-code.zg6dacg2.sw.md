# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the login validation feature in the Todo application.

The feature validates user login credentials against the database.

We will cover:

1. Why we use a DAO class for login validation.
2. How the database connection is managed.
3. How the SQL query is constructed and executed.
4. How exceptions are handled.

# DAO class for login validation

<SwmSnippet path="/LoginDao.java" line="10">

---

We use the <SwmToken path="/LoginDao.java" pos="11:4:4" line-data="public class LoginDao {">`LoginDao`</SwmToken> class to encapsulate the login validation logic. This class provides a method to validate user credentials.

```

public class LoginDao {

	public boolean validate(LoginBean loginBean) throws ClassNotFoundException {
		boolean status = false;

		Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
```

# Managing database connection

<SwmSnippet path="/LoginDao.java" line="17">

---

We obtain a database connection using the `JDBCUtils.getConnection()` method. This ensures that the connection is managed efficiently and closed properly after use.

```

		try (Connection connection = JDBCUtils.getConnection();
				// Step 2:Create a statement using connection object
				PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection
						.prepareStatement("select * from users where username = ? and password = ? ")) {
			preparedStatement.setString(1, loginBean.getUsername());
			preparedStatement.setString(2, loginBean.getPassword());
```

# Constructing and executing the SQL query

<SwmSnippet path="/LoginDao.java" line="24">

---

We prepare a SQL statement to select user records matching the provided username and password. This query is executed to check if the user exists in the database.

```

			System.out.println(preparedStatement);
			ResultSet rs = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
			status = rs.next();

		} catch (SQLException e) {
			// process sql exception
			JDBCUtils.printSQLException(e);
		}
		return status;
	}
}
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Handling exceptions

<SwmSnippet path="/LoginDao.java" line="24">

---

SQL exceptions are caught and processed using a utility method from `JDBCUtils`. This helps in logging and debugging any issues that arise during database operations.

```

			System.out.println(preparedStatement);
			ResultSet rs = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
			status = rs.next();

		} catch (SQLException e) {
			// process sql exception
			JDBCUtils.printSQLException(e);
		}
		return status;
	}
}
```

This concludes the walkthrough of the login validation feature. The design decisions ensure that the code is modular, maintainable, and handles database operations efficiently.
